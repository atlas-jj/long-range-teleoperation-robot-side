How can you define a different package name other than  ORB_SLAM?
simple, just rename the folder, under ORS, change ORB_SLAM2 to ORB_SLAM2_v1 for example.
also, change build_ros.sh, change the directory name.

or firstly , do unlinking, 
sudo ln -s /media/chris/vol/fc/CARV+VS/codes/Examples/ROS/ORB_CARV /opt/ros/kinetic/share/ORB_CARV
then compile

if say no rule to make target...
delete build folder and build again.
